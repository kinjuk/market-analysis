Riding the Fear Curve: A SPY/VIX Divergence Strategy

When uncertainty rises, the VIX tends to spikes dramatically, while equity indices like the S&P 500 tend to drop. This is well-known but what’s more interesting is that VIX tends to lead, while SPY tends to lag. The resulting divergence has historically signaled inflection points where fear gets ahead of actual price damage (or vice versa but less common).
This is not a new phenomenon. During the COVID crash, for instance, VIX soared above 80 while SPY collapsed in a straight line. But a closer look reveals smaller divergences in calmer periods, which can be used to time entries or exits on a shorter time horizon. This strategy doesn’t try to predict the future. Instead, it responds to the relationship between the implied volatility and price behavior of the S&P 500. It's not about the VIX alone, it's about how fast the VIX is rising or falling relative to what SPY is doing and how that gap can close (arbitrage-like if you will).

Strategy Rules
1. Assets Traded: 
SPY (long-only)
VIX is used as a signal but not traded directly.

2. Signal Construction: 
Calculate % change in VIX over a short window (e.g., 2–3 days).
Calculate % change in SPY over the same window.
If VIX rises sharply (> +20%) while SPY is flat or down moderately (< –1%), this is considered a fear spike divergence.

3. Entry Logic:
Enter long SPY at close on divergence signal.
Optionally scale in if the divergence widens the next day.

4. Exit Logic:
Close position when SPY recovers by > +2% OR
VIX drops back by > –15% from recent spike

5. Risk Management:
5% stop-loss from entry
Max holding period: 5 trading days
Trade size capped at 5% of capital

6. Edge Hypothesis:
The market tends to overreact to uncertainty faster than actual price deterioration occurs. SPY often rebounds once fear overshoots.

7. Backtest Notes:
Strategy performs best in sideways to declining volatility regimes, and may underperform during strong trends or prolonged risk-off events.
