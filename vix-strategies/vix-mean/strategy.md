Riding the Mean: A VIX Regression Deviation Strategy

The VIX doesn’t just reflect fear — it exaggerates it. While price action unfolds gradually, volatility often reacts in dramatic bursts. This creates fertile ground for statistical mean reversion. Rather than chasing VIX spikes as standalone events, this strategy frames them as deviations from a rolling regression line — a statistically grounded estimate of fair value.

The goal is not to forecast direction but to respond to abnormal volatility shocks that historically correct within days. The VIX may surge or collapse, but when that move exceeds a regression-based expectation, it often represents an overreaction rather than a new trend. This strategy aims to exploit those overreactions — by trading VIX futures both long and short when price strays too far from its mean.

Strategy Rules

Assets Traded:
VIX Futures (long and short positions allowed)

Signal Construction:

Fit a linear regression line to the trailing 60 days of VIX values

Predict today’s expected VIX value based on that regression

Measure percent deviation of actual VIX from predicted value:

(VIX_actual - VIX_predicted) / VIX_predicted * 100

Short Signal: If VIX exceeds the predicted value by more than +20%, and SPY has not fallen more than 1% on the day, this signals a potential volatility overshoot (short entry)

Long Signal: If VIX falls more than 20% below the predicted value, and SPY is flat or rising on the day, this signals a potential volatility undershoot (long entry)

Entry Logic:
Enter short or long VIX futures at close on the day of the signal, depending on whether deviation is positive or negative.

Exit Logic:

Close position when VIX returns to within 5% of the regression line
OR

SPY moves by more than ±2% from signal day close in the direction that invalidates the trade
OR

Max holding period of 7 trading days is reached

Risk Management:

3% stop-loss from VIX entry level

Max holding period: 7 trading days

Trade size capped at 5% of capital

Optional cooldown period after any stop-out: 5 trading days

Edge Hypothesis:
VIX frequently overshoots or undershoots its trend due to market reflexes and panic hedging. These overreactions tend to mean-revert rapidly, especially in non-crisis environments. By anchoring VIX behavior to a rolling regression, this strategy attempts to isolate short-term dislocations that are inconsistent with actual market pricing.

Backtest Notes:

Strategy is sensitive to regression window — shorter windows may be more reactive but noisier

Most effective in choppy or sideways markets

May underperform in trending markets where fear or complacency is justified and prolonged

Useful when paired with volatility filters or macro overlays to confirm conditions

This is not a bet against volatility — it’s a bet against emotional overreach.
